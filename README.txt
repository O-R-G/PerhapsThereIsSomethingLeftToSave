Perhaps There is Something Left to Save

Given the most commonly used criteria of *utility* for software, it’s not surprising that the screensaver is a debased form. It does nothing, it says nothing and it takes you nowhere. Instead it offers a quiet, even ambient portrait of a system — a simple image, a complex algorithm, and an ever-changing picture of their interaction.

Still there may be something to doing nothing. The computer, Alan Turing’s universal machine tirelessly capable of emulating the behavior of any other tool, is finally given a rest. After three minutes or so of nothing, the screensaver kicks in and the software produces a silently reconfiguring image of a system falling into and out of phase, automatically generating a fleeting picture of interference and coordination on your computer screen. Perhaps there is something left to save.

Included is screensaver software designed for current Apple Macintosh OS X operating systems.--

Please register your purchase with O-R-G by emailing us at support@o-r-g.com with your name, receipt number, and title of the software. 

To install, double-click the .saver file. This opens the System Preferences Desktop & Screen Saver pane and asks to install the software. Click INSTALL. Then, sit back and do nothing—the screensaver will start soon enough.

If you get this error: “... can’t be opened because it was not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Your security preferences allow installation of only apps from the Mac App Store.” Then open your System Preferences and navigate to “Security and Privacy” > “General” and under “Allow apps downloaded from:” select “Mac App Store and identified developers”.
All softwares are programmed by O-R-G and are also available online at
